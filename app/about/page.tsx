          <p className="text-xl">
            <strong>VeerPreps</strong> (formerly IIT Kirba) is a dedicated study material platform designed exclusively for VSSUT Burla students. It provides previous year question papers, lecture notes, and carefully curated YouTube playlists to help students prepare efficiently for mid-semester, end-semester, and backlog exams. Our goal is to make academic resources easily accessible to every student, saving them valuable time and effort.

            The platform was founded by <strong>Gyanaranjan Patra</strong>, an Information Technology undergraduate from VSSUT Burla (Batch 2027). Like many students, Gyanaranjan faced challenges in his first year, struggling to find the right study materials at the right time. The scattered nature of resources made exam preparation stressful, and he realized the need for a centralized hub where students could access all essential materials in one place. This led to the creation of <strong>VeerPreps</strong>—a one-stop solution designed to simplify the learning process.
